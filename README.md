IOS Fondation basic course project created by: Pasquale Sorrentino, Leonardo Iovino, Pasquale Cocchiero, Mario Daino, Cristian Nino Di Palma, Chiara Scibelli, Marianna Commisso, Emma Lattero.

Our app was born asking us the question: "Are you able to recognize your dreams?"
Very often we do not remember what we dreamed or if we try to remember it is strange, illogical.
There are many advantages of remembering a dream:
better mood, creativity, inspiration, memory and sharper thinking.
What if it was possible to reproduce dreams on the device?
We interviewed a sample of 400 people (mostly workers and students of various age):
DO YOU REMEMBER YOUR DREAMS?
23% answered YES, 5% answred No, 73% answred Not always 

DO YOU THINK THAT DREAMS ARE 
ABLE  TO INFLUENCE YOU DURING EVERYDAY LIFE?
31% answred No, 45% answred Yes, 24% answred I don't know

WOULD YOU LIKE TO REPRODUCE 
YOUR DREAMS ON A DEVICE?
83% answred Yes and 17% answred No

HOW CAN WE HELP PEOPLE REMEMBER THEIR DREAMS?
DREAMY, YOUR SMART DIARY!
